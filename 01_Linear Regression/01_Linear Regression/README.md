### __Linear regression is used for finding linear relationship between target and one or more predictors.__
> The __core idea__ is to obtain a line that __best fits__ the data. The best fit line is the one for which total prediction error (all data points) are as small as possible. Error is the distance between the point to the regression line.

hence Simple linear regression predicts a quantitative outcome variable __y__, on the basis of a single predictor variable __x__.
