### __Linear regression is used for finding linear relationship between target and one or more predictors.__
> The __core idea__ is to obtain a line that __best fits__ the data. The best fit line is the one for which total prediction error (all data points) are as small as possible. Error is the distance between the point to the regression line.

hence Simple linear regression predicts a __Quantitative outcome__ variable __y__, on the basis of a single predictor variable __x__.

> An important __Assumption__ of the linear regression model is that the relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome is __Linear__ and __Additive__.
