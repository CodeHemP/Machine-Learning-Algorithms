# Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a __Statistical technique__ that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable.The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors).

### __The Multiple regression model is based on the following assumptions:__

- _There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variables._
- _The independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other._
- _yi observations are selected independently and randomly from the population._
- _Residuals should be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance Ïƒ._
