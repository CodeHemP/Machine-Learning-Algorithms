# __Logistic Regression__

> Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis, is a type of __Predictive Modeling__ technique which is used to find the relationship between a __dependent variable__ (usually known as the “Y” variable) and either one independent variable (the “X” variable) or a __Series__ of independent variables. When two or more independent variables are used to predict or explain the outcome of the dependent variable, this is known as multiple regression.

### __Regression analysis can be used for three things:__

  - __Forecasting the effects or impact of specific changes.__ For example, if a manufacturing company wants to forecast how many units of a particular product they need to produce in order to meet the current demand.
 
  - __Forecasting trends and future values.__ For example, how much will the stock price of  Lufthansa be in 6 months from now?
 
 - __Determining the strength of different predictors__ —or, in other words, assessing how much of an impact the independent variable(s) has on a dependent variable. For example, if a soft drinks company is sponsoring a football match, they might want to determine if the ads being displayed during the match have accounted for any increase in sales.
 
 ### __Logistic regression assumptions__
 
 - __The dependent variable is binary__.
 - __There should be no, or very little, multicollinearity between the predictor variables.__
 - __The independent variables should be linearly related to the log odds.__
 - __Logistic regression requires fairly large sample sizes__
